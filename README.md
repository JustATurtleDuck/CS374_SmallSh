# CS_374-SmallSh
This is the code I turned in for the smallsh assignment.

Requirements are found in required.md

## Compile Instructions:
	1. Use the compiler command ‘gcc -o smallsh main.c -std=gnu99 ’

	2. Use the compiler command ‘chmod +x p3testscript’

	3. Use ‘./p3testscript 2>&1 | more’ , ‘./p3testscript 2>&1’ or ‘./p3testscript > mytestresults 2>&1’ to run the script
		a. Using the last one will require you to look in a newly created file
